          Our mission is to make college a fun and delicious experience. We came together from diffrent walks of life and met at a college campus. We both were interested in food so we came together and started making food for people. Eventually we decided to open up a Bar &amp; Grill for the people we were cooking for. Again our mission is to make college fun and delicious since we personally know what its like to feel the pressure of school, and want good food all the time.
