	<p>Our food is inspired by the college in this town. We have college kids around us, so we have exactly the type of food they want! We make some of the best burgers and steaks in town. We use our special in house rub on all our meats. We also have very crispy chicken from secrect batter we use. We also have imported beers for anyone looking to be adverturous with their alcohol.</p>
